<div style='font-size:14px;color:#888'>The Davidian Seventh-day Adventists Association</div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Provisional in set-up as well as in name, the Davidian Seventh-day Adventist Association exists solely to accomplish a divinely appointed work within the Seventh-day Adventist denomination, wherein it therefore strictly confines its activities.  As its work therewithin draws to a close, and the "servants of our God" (Rev. 7:3) are sealed, its name will be changed (Isa. 56:5; 62:2; 65:15) and its purpose and its work will become all-embracing to the gospel (Matt. 17:11; Acts 3:21, Isa. 61:4-7).  Then its Constitution and By-Laws as <a title="The Leviticus of The Davidian Seventh-day Adventists" href="https://www.gadsda.com/the-leviticus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">herein</a> codified will become fully operative.</p>

<div style='background-color:#444;padding-top:1px'></div>
<center><p>The <strong>object of this Association is to bring about among God's people that reformation called for in the <i>Testimonies for the Church</i>, Volume 9, page 126,</strong> as the prerequisite movement to sounding the “Eleventh-Hour Call” (Matt. 20:6, 7) of “the everlasting gospel...to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people.” <br>Rev. 14:6.</p></center>
<div style='background-color:#444;padding-top:1px'></div>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The name, Davidian, deriving from the name of the king of Ancient Israel, accrues to this Association by reason of its following aspects: First, it is dedicated to the work of announcing and bringing forth the restoration (as predicted in Hosea 1:11; 3:5) of David's kingdom in antitype, upon the throne of which Christ, "the son of David," is to sit. Second, it purports itself to be the first of the first fruits of the living, the vanguard from among the present-day descendants of those Jews who composed the Early Christian Church. With the emergence of this vanguard and its army, the first fruits, from which are elected the 12,000 out of each of the twelve tribes of Jacob, "the 144,000" (Rev. 14:1; 7:2-8) who stand on Mount Zion with the Lamb (Rev. 14:1; 7:2-8), the reign of antitypical David begins.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The name Seventh-day Adventist, which this Association inherits from the parent denomination, is provisional (Isa. 62:2) and only for the duration of its work within the parent denomination.</p>
